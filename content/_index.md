## About me {#about class="pb-8 text-2xl font-medium text-center md:text-4xl pt-14 md:pt-20"}

I can help you make sense of the difficulties you experience and the issues that are preventing
change. Some of these difficulties may involve low mood, low self-esteem, grief and loss,
stressful life transitions, anxiety problems, phobias, relationship difficulties or unusual
experiences.

My training enables me to draw from a variety of evidence-based models. I work in a trauma-focused
way, which means I consider past difficulties in life as important in understanding the present.
Exploring these can be key to moving forward and living a life that is more fulfilling.  As an
integrative practitioner, I believe it is important to tailor the therapy to your needs and help
you integrate different parts of yourself.

I have a heart for helping people connect with nature, art and their community.

## Training and Experience {#experience class="pb-8 text-2xl font-medium text-center md:text-4xl pt-14 md:pt-20"}

I have a doctorate in Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy) and a foundation in Systemic Family Therapy.
I have worked with many different people presenting with many different problems in their lives
and I will meet you where you are at.

I am registered with the Health & Care Professions Council (HCPC).
